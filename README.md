Converts BookSmart photo books into ODT (LibreOffice Writer).  Only tested with my own photo books.

No documentation is provided, but you can run `./book2odt.py --help`.  Will need to be pointed at your .book file.

Requires ezodf, lxml, and PIL python modules.  And probably others I've forgotten.
